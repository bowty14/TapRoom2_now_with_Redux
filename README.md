#### By Tyler Bowerman

## Description
This is a program that allows you to add a Kombucha flavor to a TapRoom, you can update and delete them if need be.



## User Stories
* Completed 
As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kombucha kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and flavor.
As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg.

* Extra features
As a user, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
As a user, I want to be able to delete a keg.

* Still under construction
As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
